# there is also support for setting configs other ways, as well as secrets. these other options are discussed 
# in the CF2025 beta docs, and I plan to offer more  compose examples showing such other "config" alternatives.
# my main goal in offering this one is to help people know about this option, and that it does NOT require using Swarm
