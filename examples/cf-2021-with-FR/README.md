## Expected result

Listing containers must show one container running and the port mapping as below (note that the version reported may differ for you, in using the "latest" tag):
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                         NAMES
b3c41fac7599   cf-2021-latest-fr_coldfusion   "sh /opt/startup/sta…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8088->8088/tcp, 8118/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8500->8500/tcp, 45564/tcp   cf-2021-latest-fr-coldfusion-1
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8500` in your web browser to see available files in CF's default webroot (added to by the /app volume mapping)

See readme in [cf-latest/README.md](../cf-latest/README.md) folder for more.

Run `http://localhost:8088` in your web browser to see the FusionReactor login page, or run via curl:
```
$ curl http://localhost:8088/
```

Stop and remove the containers
```
$ docker compose down
```
